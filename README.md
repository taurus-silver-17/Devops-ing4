## This is the introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The purpose of this directory is to respond to an homework of Devops. The goal is to put into practice the right methodology for a Devops project.

## Requirements for this project <a name="assignements"></a>
 As a reminder, here are the notation criteria for the DEVOPS project:
- Use git, use branches, use tags
- Your project must have tests with a testing framework (depending on the language used)
- If you project uses external dependencies such as a database, use docker-compose to start it before the test session.
- Configure your project to use a CI server
- Provide a "README" file explaining how to launch your project, how to launch the tests, what problems your had

## The project <a name="theproject"></a>
We started from a project that Arnaud had already realized with a former colleague, this project is described and accessible in "the release v1.0". 

The goal of the project is to manage lights via a raspberry pi, we realized the same principle almost but this time with containers. We remind nevertheless that if the code doesn't work, the goal of this project is not a computer project but a Devops project.
